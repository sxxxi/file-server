Experimenting with error handling methods, I am not sure which one to stick to. On one hand there is pattern matching and on the other, there are methods (and_then(), or_else(), etc.). Both are good but I feel like pattern matching makes my codebase cluttered while the latter can be hard to read at times. IDK
I also should refrain from using 'unwrap()' if I want to build real-time systems. Just saying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
